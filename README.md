AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to many clients. They have a client called Excel Stores, which are normal stores across India. AtliQ Hardware has a head office in Delhi, India, and several regional offices throughout the country.

Bhavan Patel is the sales director for this company and he's facing a lot of challenges. The market is growing dynamically, and he's having trouble tracking sales in this rapidly growing market. He's also struggling with gaining insights into his business.

The challenge is that Bhavan has Regional Managers for North India, South India, and Central India. When he wants insights into these three regions, he calls these managers. However, these insights are given verbally over the phone. The managers tend to paint a positive picture, sometimes even sugarcoating the facts or providing incomplete information.

Bhavan is frustrated because he knows the overall sales are declining, but he's not getting a complete picture from the regional managers. When he asks for numbers, they provide him with numerous complex Excel files. AtliQ Hardware has many clients, resulting in vast amounts of data in these files.

Bhavan finds it overwhelming to process so many Excel files. He needs a simplified, understandable way to understand how the business is doing and identify the areas that need focus. He believes that a picture is worth a thousand words. He's interested in a dashboard, a visualization of real data sourced from a correct and reliable source.

If he had a visualization like the one shown in the image, he could easily see how the numbers are trending. He could even set up monthly email reminders where Power BI would send him an email summarizing the business performance in terms of revenues, customers, and more. This way, Bhavan wouldn't have to rely on the managers for information. He could make data-driven decisions based on accurate insights, ultimately helping increase sales for his company. That concludes the introduction.
